AIM:IMPLEMENTION AND ANALYSIS OF N QUEEN PROBLEM.

THEORY:In N-Queen problem, we are given an NxN chessboard and we have to place N number of queens on the board in such a way that no two queens attack each other. A queen will attack another queen if it is placed in horizontal, vertical or diagonal points in its way. The most popular approach for solving the N Queen puzzle is Backtracking.

ALGORITHM:
Step 1 -Place the first queen in the top-left cell of the chessboard.
Step 2 -After placing a queen in the first cell, mark the position as a part of the solution and then recursively check if this will lead to a solution.
Step 3 -Now, if placing the queen doesnâ€™t lead to a solution. Then go to the first step and place queens in other cells. Repeat until all cells are tried.
Step 4 -If placing queen returns a lead to solution return TRUE.
Step 5 -If all queens are placed return TRUE.
Step 6 -If all rows are tried and no solution is found, return FALSE.
